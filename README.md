## 🚀 About Me

🔬 I’m a dedicated **Post Graduate Embedded Systems Engineer** with expertise in **IoT**, **LoRaWAN**, **Battery Management Systems**, **Edge AI**, and **RTOS-based development**.

🧠 With an M.Tech in Embedded Systems from **CDAC Mohali (operating under the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, Government of India)**, I have contributed to a variety of high-impact projects including medical imaging devices, smart agriculture systems, and military-grade embedded platforms.

🛠 I enjoy working on full-stack embedded solutions — from PCB design to firmware development to cloud interfacing — with a special love for **hands-on prototyping**.
